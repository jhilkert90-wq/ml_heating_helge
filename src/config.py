"""
Centralized Configuration for the ML Heating Script.

This file consolidates all user-configurable parameters for the application.
It uses the `dotenv` library to load settings from a `.env` file, allowing for
easy management of sensitive information like API keys and environment-specific
settings without hardcoding them into the source.

The configuration is organized into logical sections:
- API Credentials and Endpoints
- File Paths for persistent data
- Model & History Parameters for feature engineering
- Home Assistant Entity IDs (Core, Blocking, and Additional Sensors)
- Tuning & Debug Parameters for runtime behavior
- Metrics Entity IDs for performance monitoring

It is crucial to create a `.env` file and customize these settings, especially
the `HASS_URL`, `HASS_TOKEN`, and all `*_ENTITY_ID` variables, to match your
specific Home Assistant setup.
